## Overview

Development of a sophisticated machine learning system that analyzes historical player data, biometric information, and game statistics to predict performance trends and optimize training programs for UCSB athletes.

## Key Features

- **Performance Prediction Models**: Implemented ensemble machine learning models that combine multiple data sources to predict player performance with high accuracy.
- **Biometric Data Integration**: Created a secure system for collecting and analyzing athlete biometric data, including heart rate, sleep patterns, and training load.
- **Training Optimization**: Developed algorithms that recommend personalized training adjustments based on predicted performance trends and fatigue levels.
- **Injury Prevention**: Built predictive models that identify potential injury risks based on training patterns and performance indicators.

## Technologies Used

- **Python & Scikit-learn**: For building and training machine learning models
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For deep learning models analyzing complex performance patterns
- **InfluxDB**: For time-series biometric data storage
- **FastAPI**: For building the prediction API endpoints
- **React & D3.js**: For the front-end visualization dashboard

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was developing accurate prediction models that could account for the numerous variables affecting athletic performance. We implemented a novel approach combining traditional statistical methods with deep learning to capture both linear and non-linear relationships in the data. Another significant challenge was ensuring the privacy and security of athlete biometric data while maintaining easy access for authorized personnel.

## Outcome

The prediction system has significantly improved UCSB's ability to optimize training programs and prevent injuries. Teams using the system have seen a 25% reduction in training-related injuries and a 15% improvement in peak performance timing. The system's success has made it an essential tool for UCSB's coaching staff in developing personalized training strategies.
