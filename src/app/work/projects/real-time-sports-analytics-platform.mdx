## Overview

Development of a state-of-the-art sports analytics platform specifically designed for UCSB Athletics, combining real-time data processing with advanced machine learning algorithms to provide actionable insights.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Analytics Engine**: Built a high-performance data processing pipeline that handles live game statistics, player tracking data, and team performance metrics with sub-second latency.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implemented advanced ML models for player performance prediction, strategy optimization, and injury prevention using historical and real-time data.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Created dynamic heat maps, player movement tracking, and performance trend analysis tools using D3.js and WebGL for smooth real-time updates.
- **Team Collaboration Platform**: Developed a secure platform for coaches and analysts to share insights, create custom reports, and collaborate on strategy development.

## Technologies Used

- **Python & TensorFlow**: For data processing and machine learning models
- **Next.js & D3.js**: For the web interface and interactive visualizations
- **PostgreSQL & TimescaleDB**: For efficient time-series data storage
- **WebSocket & Redis**: For real-time data streaming
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: For scalable deployment

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was processing and analyzing large volumes of real-time sports data while maintaining low latency. We implemented efficient data processing pipelines and optimized our database queries using TimescaleDB's specialized time-series capabilities. Another significant challenge was creating intuitive visualizations that could effectively communicate complex statistical patterns to coaches and players in real-time during games.

## Outcome

The platform has become an integral part of UCSB's athletic programs, providing coaches and analysts with powerful tools for performance analysis and strategic decision-making. The real-time insights have contributed to improved team performance across multiple sports, and the platform's success has led to interest from other collegiate athletic programs.
